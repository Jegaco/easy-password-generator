# easy-password-generator

## Description
## Challenge 03 JavaScript Password Generator
In this project the task was to modify the starter code that was given and create an application that allows 
employees/users to generate a randomized password based on criteria they have selected. This app will run in the browser and alert the user with prompts for the password criteria when the "Generate a Password" is clicked.

## Challenges

The required criteria are as follows:
* GIVEN I need a new, secure password 

* WHEN I click the button to generate a password, THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

* WHEN prompted for password criteria, THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

* WHEN prompted for the length of the password, THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password, THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

* WHEN I answer each prompt, THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

* WHEN all prompts are answered, THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

* WHEN the password is generated, THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
